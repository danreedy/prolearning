Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:
  
  * Choose a theme style in app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css is loaded in application.css
    with `require_tree .` or `require dresssed`.

  * Ensure `require dresssed` has been added to
    app/assets/javascripts/application.js.

  * Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
    For example:
    
      root :to => "home#index"
    
  * If you are deploying on Heroku, you may want to set:
    
      config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
    
    On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
    or load models when precompiling your assets.
  
  * Browse the theme documentation:
    
      Rails Integration: http://gimlet.dresssed.com/rails
      Bootstrap documentation: http://gimlet.dresssed.com/bootstrap/scaffolding

  * Lastly, restart your server if it's already running.
<% if can_customize? %>
If you want to fully customize your theme (edit LESS variables and be picky
about what is being put in your CSS), run `rails generate dresssed:customize`.
If you just want to change the logo, see app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.
