You're ready to customize your theme!
                    
The theme can now be fully customized in:

  app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.less

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:
  
  * Ensure `gem 'less-rails'` has been added to your Gemfile.

  * Remove app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css. Port your changes to
    dresssed.css.less if any.

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/dresssed.css.less is loaded in
    application.css with `require_tree .` or `require dresssed`.

  * Lastly, restart your server if it's already running.

                                             Any problem? dresssed@codedinc.com
